Have you ever wondered what happens when you die? Like, is it _the end_ just like that?
All the memories, bonds, feelings, emotions- will all of them amount to nothing?
I doubt that. Would you be able to look death into it's eye and embrace it? I mean, I
sure was afraid and sad thinking about leaving everyone first... but then- the more
I think, the more natural it became to me. 

Death is inevitable. No one can escape it. Then why don't we talk more about it?
I do not mean it in a morbid depressing way but more like, a not taboo sense. Like
have some silly stuff planned around for our families, our loved ones- so they would
not feel alone suddenly. It's kinda unfair noe? To suddenly disappear from someone's
life... hence a small attempt through this post. 

Ofc I'll write a more detailed post regarding what I want during my funeral, for now
I only wanted to share a perspective. Listen, if you are reading this- our paths
might have crossed at some point in life and I hope I had some positive influence
on your life. I'm truly am sorry if that is not the case, do forgive me if possible.

The time one spends with themselves is really something, right? When no one's watching,
no judgements, no right, no wrong, you can let your shields down and rest. nothing can
can hurt you in that very moment. I'm coming here almost after two years- demnn and I 
still feel like it's yesterday, lol.


Anyway, thank you so much for reading!
